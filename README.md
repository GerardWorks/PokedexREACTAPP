POKEMON - POKEDEX
This was my experimentation with React, consuming an API and rendering to the DOM using stateless functional components.

Challenges:
- Understanding states and remembering to bind 'this' to the class.
- Learning to stateless functional components as much as possible.
- React-chartjs was also used to provide the radar graph, understanding the documentation.
